# Test Firmware Update

This project is intended to locate files to perform FOTA and USB firmware update on the Edge Device.

## Files in gitlab

Each .zip contains files which shall be uploaded to CSide server to perform the firmware updates by FOTA.
Its names indicate the sequence to be performed in order to confirm different tests.

In case of firmware update by USB, each file shall be extracted in the USB separately.
Like FOTA, sequence to be performed will be indicated by files names.
